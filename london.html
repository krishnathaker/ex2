  <p> This is a photo of a random building with a clock that I found interesting while walking around central London. This city has such great Victorian architecture- it was heaven for an architecture-buff like me!</p>

  <p> This is a photo of a part of the city of London as seen from the roof-top Sky Garden. It was an absolutely spectacular view, and I wish there was a way to take photos without a glass barrier in between.</p>
