  <h1>Cities of the British Isles</h1>
  <p> This magazine has been put together by me as an attempt to help fellow travellers gain a better understanding about what to expect in some of the cities in the British Isles. To give you some background, I am a 20-year old college student who solo-travelled
    around the British Isles for 20 days in Summer 2016. I picked the British Isles for my first European experience since I grew up in India, which was a large British Colony. The city I lived in, Bombay, has been tremendously influenced by English culture;
    it's evident in our streets, our buildings, the architecture, the modern urban planning, our train stations, even our post boxes! I always wanted to visit Britain to experience their culture first-hand, and I must say, it was a great experience! So
    here are five of the nine places I visited during my trip (ranked in no particular order). I hope you enjoy viewing the photos just as much as I enjoyed taking them! </p>
